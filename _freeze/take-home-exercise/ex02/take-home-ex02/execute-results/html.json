Yet, illicit drug consumption remains highly prevalent and continues to be a growing problem worldwide. In 2021, 1 in 17 people aged 15–64 in the world had used a drug in the past 12 months. Notwithstanding population growth, the estimated number of drug users grew from 240 million in 2011 to 296 million in 2021.\n\nThe geopolitics of Thailand which is near the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)) of Indochina, the largest drug production site in Asia, and the constant transportation infrastructure development made Thailand became market and transit routes for drug trafficking to the third countries.\n\nIn Thailand, drug abuse is one of the major social issue. There are about 2.7 million youths using drugs in Thailand. Among youths aged between 15 and 19 years, there are about 300,000 who have needs for drug treatment. Most of Thai youths involved with drugs are vocational-school students, which nearly doubles in number compared to secondary-school students.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe main objectives of this exercise are to determine:\n\n1.  If the key indicators of drug abuse of Thailand are independent from space.\n2.  If the indicators of drug abuse is indeed spatial dependent, then, we would like to detect where are the clusters and outliers, and the hotspots.\n3.  Last but not least, we are also interested to investigate how the observations above evolve over time.\n\n## Data\n\nFor the purpose of this take-home exercise, two data sets shall be used, they are:\n\n-   [Thailand Drug Offenses \\[2017-2022\\]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-drug-offenses-2017-2022) at Kaggle.\n\n-   [Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tha?) at HDX. You are required to use the province boundary data set.\n\n# Importing the Necessary and Data Cleaning\n\n## Importing the packages\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, tmap, sfdep)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Importing the data sets\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read the administrative boundaries (province level)\n# Keep only the columns \"ADM1_EN\", \"ADM1_TH\", and \"ADM1_PCODE\"\nprovince_sf <- st_read(dsn=\"data/geospatial/tha_adm_rtsd_itos_20210121_shp\", layer = \"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\") %>% \n  select(c(3:5))\n\n# Read the drug abuse data set\ndrug <- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/thai_drug_offenses_2017_2022.csv\", \n                 show_col_types = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Joining statistical data set to geospatial data set\n\nNow let us do a join of the drug abuse data set with the admin boundary layer, so that we can map the drug abuse data spatially.\n\nTo do so, we can do a join using the common province names between two data sets. There are two ways to do the join:\n\n1.  using the English province name\n2.  using the Thai province name\n\nThe code chunk belows joins using the English province name\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Join both data sets by common province names (English)\n# to form a geospatial data containing drug abuse statistics\ndrug_sf <- left_join(province_sf, drug, by = c(\"ADM1_EN\" = \"province_en\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLooking at the results, we realise that the number of observations have dropped, meaning some drug abuse data is lost. This is likely due to mismatched names, perhaps due a non-standard translation of the province names.\n\nAs seen below, originally, there are 7392 rows of data in `drug`, this has fell to 7202 rows of data after the join in `drug_sf`.\n\n![](images/clipboard-2846821927.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nLet us do a join using the Thai name instead.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Join both data sets by common province names (Thai)\n# to form a geospatial data containing drug abuse statistics\ndrug_sf <- left_join(province_sf, drug, by = c(\"ADM1_TH\" = \"province_th\")) %>% select (c(1:6))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n![](images/clipboard-906144215.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nLooking at this result, we can see that no data is lost, so let us continue with this method (joining using common Thai province names) instead.\n\n## Quick View of the Data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code chunk eval is currently set to false, no output will be shown\n# Quick view of the province boundaries layer\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntmap_options(max.categories = 77)\nqtm(province_sf, fill = \"ADM1_EN\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nReferring to the [Take-Home-Exercise 2 Source](https://is415-ay2024-25t1.netlify.app/th_ex2), which include a pre-prepared map of the drug use cases over the years (as shown below), we can see that drug abuse cases appears to be most frequent in the fiscal years 2019 and 2021.\n\n![](images/th_ex2_img1-1.png)\n\nThis visualisation, however, does not separate the different types of drug abuse cases recorded within the drug data set.

The spatial distribution of drug production cases is not random but rather exhibits clustering patterns. This indicates strong spatial dependencies among the cases, which should be considered in further analysis and decision-making.\n\nFurthermore, the Moran I statistic value of all the tests are positive, which indicates signs of clustering. We can therefore conclude that clustering occurs, whether is it high-high, or low-low clusters.\n\n# Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation\n\nNow, since we can determine that the indicators of drug abuse, in this case drug production, are not spatially independent, and they in fact shows signs of spatial dependency and clustering.

LISA Test Conclusion\n\nComparing the LISA Maps over the years, it is clear that the southern provinces of Thailand, specifically around the provinces such as Nakhon Si Thammarat, Krabi, Trang, Phatthalung, Songkla, is likely an ongoing hotspot (to be determined) for drug production as they have remained a **high-high cluster consistently** throughout the years.\n\nIn contrast, the mid-western provinces, specifically around the provinces such as Nakhon Sawan, is more of a coldspot (to be determined) for drug production, where the area has a **low-low clusters** of drug production cases.\n\nAn interesting observation is in year 2020, where the province Ranong was a **low-high outlier**–where itself had a low count drug production cases while its surrounding provinces had high counts of such cases–but in the subsequent years (2021, 2022), it turned into a **high-high cluster**, likely indicating the spread of drug production from its neighbouring states.\n\nAnother less interesting observation is the province of Phrase in 2017, and the province of Sakon Nakhon in 2020, which both exhibited a **high-low outlier**, showing that their drug production cases is higher than their neighbours. However, the trends do not continue into subsequent years, so not much conclusions can be drawn.\n\nNo definitive conclusion can be made about the hot spots and cold spots yet, however, as LISA is a localised measure that only considers the number of cases of each province relative to its immediate neighbours, and it does not represent a absolutely high or low values on a larger, regional scale; it only shows signs of clusterings and outliers.\n\n# Hot Spot and Cold Spot Area Analysis (HCSA)\n\n## Computing Inversed Distance Weight Matrix (Queens)\n\nLet us reuse the neighbours computed in our previous weight matrix (followed by the manual edit), then compute the new inversed distance weight matrix based on that. Note that our coordinates system is still using WGS84, therefore there might be small inaccuracies. However, since the provinces are relatively large, the inaccuracies should be fine (I hope.)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnb_list <- wm_2017$nb\n\nwm_2017_idw <- drug_2017 %>%\n  mutate( nb = nb_list, # using the previously used neighbour column\n          wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, geometry, scale = 1, alpha = 1),\n          .before = 1 )\n\nwm_2018_idw <- drug_2018 %>%\n  mutate( nb = nb_list, # using the previously used neighbour column\n          wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, geometry, scale = 1, alpha = 1),\n          .before = 1 )\n\nwm_2019_idw <- drug_2019 %>%\n  mutate( nb = nb_list, # using the previously used neighbour column\n          wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, geometry, scale = 1, alpha = 1),\n          .before = 1 )\n\nwm_2020_idw <- drug_2020 %>%\n  mutate( nb = nb_list, # using the previously used neighbour column\n          wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, geometry, scale = 1, alpha = 1),\n          .before = 1 )\n\nwm_2021_idw <- drug_2021 %>%\n  mutate( nb = nb_list, # using the previously used neighbour column\n          wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, geometry, scale = 1, alpha = 1),\n          .before = 1 )\n\nwm_2022_idw <- drug_2022 %>%\n  mutate( nb = nb_list, # using the previously used neighbour column\n          wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, geometry, scale = 1, alpha = 1),\n          .before = 1 )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Computing Local Gi\\* statistics\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nHCSA_2017 <- wm_2017_idw %>% \n  mutate(local_Gi = local_gstar_perm(\n    no_cases, nb, wts, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %>%\n  unnest(local_Gi)\n\nHCSA_2018 <- wm_2018_idw %>% \n  mutate(local_Gi = local_gstar_perm(\n    no_cases, nb, wts, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %>%\n  unnest(local_Gi)\n\nHCSA_2019 <- wm_2019_idw %>% \n  mutate(local_Gi = local_gstar_perm(\n    no_cases, nb, wts, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %>%\n  unnest(local_Gi)\n\nHCSA_2020 <- wm_2020_idw %>% \n  mutate(local_Gi = local_gstar_perm(\n    no_cases, nb, wts, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %>%\n  unnest(local_Gi)\n\nHCSA_2021 <- wm_2021_idw %>% \n  mutate(local_Gi = local_gstar_perm(\n    no_cases, nb, wts, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %>%\n  unnest(local_Gi)\n\nHCSA_2022 <- wm_2022_idw %>% \n  mutate(local_Gi = local_gstar_perm(\n    no_cases, nb, wts, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %>%\n  unnest(local_Gi)\n\n# Let us get a preview of the results (using 2017 as an example)\nHCSA_2017\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSimple feature collection with 77 features and 18 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 97.34336 ymin: 5.613038 xmax: 105.637 ymax: 20.46507\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n# A tibble: 77 × 19\n   gi_star cluster    e_gi    var_gi std_dev p_value p_sim p_folded_sim skewness\n     <dbl> <fct>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>        <dbl>    <dbl>\n 1 -0.465  High    0.0151  0.000133   -0.667   0.505  0.66         0.33     1.84\n 2  0.0453 Low     0.00986 0.000352    0.212   0.832  0.44         0.22     3.11\n 3 -0.260  Low     0.0114  0.000179   -0.157   0.875  0.9          0.45     2.38\n 4 -0.485  Low     0.0154  0.000203   -0.575   0.565  0.84         0.42     1.03\n 5 -1.00   Low     0.0126  0.000120   -0.978   0.328  0.2          0.1      1.19\n 6 -0.852  Low     0.0100  0.000163   -0.723   0.470  0.04         0.02     2.10\n 7 -1.05   Low     0.0117  0.000123   -0.876   0.381  0.24         0.12     1.38\n 8 -0.929  Low     0.00892 0.0000947  -0.821   0.411  0.04         0.02     2.02\n 9 -0.832  Low     0.0102  0.000183   -0.678   0.498  0.04         0.02     2.36\n10 -0.792  Low     0.0134  0.000251   -0.677   0.498  0.64         0.32     2.12\n# ℹ 67 more rows\n# ℹ 10 more variables: kurtosis <dbl>, nb <nb>, wt <list>, ADM1_EN <chr>,\n#   ADM1_TH <chr>, ADM1_PCODE <chr>, fiscal_year <dbl>,\n#   types_of_drug_offenses <chr>, no_cases <dbl>, geometry <MULTIPOLYGON [°]>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Visualising Gi\\* Statistics on a Map\n\nLet us do a quick visualisation of the computed HCSA.

HCSA Test Conclusion\n\n**The Hot Spots**\n\nNow that we have used a distanced-based weights, the overall analysis has changed. The HCSA statistics reveal that, as previously thought when we identified the high-high cluster in LISA, the southern provinces of Thailand is a hot spot. However, this is only true for the years 2017 to 2021.\n\nIn 2022, there is actually no sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a cluster (high or low) in southern provinces of Thailand. Instead, a new hot spot has formed in the northern tip of Thailand, in a region completely separate from the hot spots of the previous years.\n\n**The Cold Spots**\n\nSimilar to my previous conclusion when we identified the low-low cluster in LISA, there exists several cold spots in the mid-western provinces of Thailand. However, the cold spots seem to change greatly throughout the years.\n\n**Stark Contrasts**\n\nStrangely, there are several cold spots in some years (such as 2019, 2020, and 2021) close to the hot spots in the southern provinces. I am unable to conclude anything based on this, but a wild guess is that there has been some factors restricting drug productions in the southern provinces since 2019.\n\nThis has continued throughout the years from 2019 until 2022, where there are no longer enough evidence to conclude that a drug production hot spot exist in the southern provinces. Instead, a completely new hot spot has emerged in the northern provinces of Thailand.\n",
