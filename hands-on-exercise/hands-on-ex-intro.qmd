This section showcases my weekly attempts at geospatial analytics for my course.

Each exercise is focused on a central topic; e.g. *Hands-on exercise 02 'Thematic Mapping and GeoVisualisation with R'* corresponding to the topic of the assignment of the week.


All analyses were done using R programming language and are for learning purposes only.
